* Powerups
 * One of each per level, player chooses when to use each
 * Lost if/when they miss the paddle
 * Earthball
  * Captured by paddle (as with a new ball) rather than bouncing off it
  * Expires when failed to be caught by the paddle (but doesn't lose a life?)
 * Airball:
  * Passes through each block playing its note but not hitting it
  * Expires when failed to be caught by the paddle (but doesn't lose a life)
 * Fireball
  * Wildcard hitting any block regardless of note
  * Passes through blocks rather than bouncing off?
  * Expires when failed to be caught by the paddle (but doesn't lose a life)
  * Moves much faster than a regular ball, so harder to catch
 * Wave (Waterball?)
  * Like airball but plays all notes in a column above the paddle
  * Fixed to the paddle like a new ball
  * Expires after a timeout (e.g., like a stream growing from paddle to to of screen then being cut off)

* Movement
 * Paddle accelerates to a maximum volicity
 * New ball starts locked to paddle until released (by spacebar), getting horizontal speed from paddle
 * Angle of ball bouncing of paddle: Make paddle act as slightly convex?
